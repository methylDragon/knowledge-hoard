## Description (and why I am doing this)

Hello! Welcome to my hoard of knowledge, shared freely and openly on the internet.

I was motivated to create this resource after continuously running up against walls when reading technical papers in various STEM fields. 

Not being able to quickly look up a concept and get a succinct, understandable definition or listing of important implications is very troublesome. Even searching for them online might yield less than stellar explanations, or take far too long to find a satisfactory one. And once I've learnt something, without repeated practice or refreshers, concepts get forgotten or become murky again.

So I figured, why not apply [the](https://github.com/methylDragon/coding-notes) [same](https://github.com/methylDragon/ros-tutorials) [approach](https://github.com/methylDragon/python-data-tools-reference) [I've](https://github.com/methylDragon/linux-reference) [had](https://github.com/methylDragon/docker-reference) [when](https://github.com/methylDragon/moveit-tutorial) [learning](https://github.com/methylDragon/pcl-ros-tutorial) [something](https://github.com/methylDragon/ros-sensor-fusion-tutorial) [new](https://github.com/methylDragon/opencv-python-reference) with general or technical knowledge, and **write or record it down in a searcheable manner**? I will also be attempting to learn or explain these concepts ideally using something like the [Feynman technique](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Feynman-technique-in-detail), but this project is meant to be quite free flowing and informal.

As such, this project will be **evergreen** for as long as I keep continuously learning. Built for myself, questionably organised, but **free and open to share**. I will be curating a list of disparate and obscure topics, as well as including explanations that I find online or come up with myself to help render those topics as understandable as I can make them.

All motivated from the idea that, **I cannot say I've learnt or understood something until I can record it down and explain it to someone else**.

Again, I'll hope to do it **as informally as possible**. I believe that keeping things light and not couched in an academic context should help a lot of making the material more accessible, and aid in avoiding burnout or anxiety from not understanding.

What are you waiting for? Time to start learning!



## Contents

I will be exploring many different topics, but I might focus on a couple, such as:

- Math
- Computer Science
- Machine Learning
- Engineering

Though you might find the occasional life sciences or humanities, or even game design/creative concept floating somewhere in my notes! I have wide and varying interests, which don't exactly lend well to deep research, but definitely helps with integrating across domains.



## Using This Resource

### On Depth of Topics Covered

By nature of the concise way the concepts and topics are presented, this resource should be treated as a way to quickly get an introduction to and familiarity of the topic. This is because this is written to aid in understanding or reading jargon-heavy literature or papers, as well as provide quick intuitive refreshers for concepts.

**The hoard is not meant to be exhaustive or definitive!**

If you needs a much more in-depth treatise on a topic, you can either look at the references if they are cited, or search up the terms yourself with the (hopefully) better understanding of the topic you've gotten from this resource.



### Using It

You should be using this resource like an encyclopedia or a reference! This is not like my other tutorials out there!

Trying to read everything in one go might overwhelm you, I think it'd overwhelm me too!

Some recommended ways to use this resource are:

- Come to this resource to get an introduction to a particular topic you are interested in.
- Keep the relevant resource for a particular domain open while you are reading a paper to quickly `ctrl-F` and search up a concept or topic.



### Programs for Reading It

Even though this is hosted on GitHub, I'd recommend cloning the repository and using something like [Typora](https://typora.io/) to read and go through the notes!

This is because having access to an **outline** of headers will make searching for topics much easier.

I'd have preferred to use something hosted online like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), but due to size and visibility constraints I decided against it.



## Things to be Grateful For

References will be mentioned in the individual topic sections under the notes. But [r/explainlikeimfive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) is going to be given a special mention for helping massively in the first few moments of trying to understand a topic.



## Contributing

Contributions by pull request will be entertained, but as this repository is a collection of things I have personally learnt, I will not merge them in until I've understood the concept!

(Of course, a quality contribution will allow me to quickly learn something new, which will then warrant it being merged in... So I guess what I'm saying is **feel free to contribute to the knowledge hoard**!)

Do ensure that any contributions are formatted similarly to the other items in the notes, and to also give credit where credit is due, and mention your sources.



## Disclaimer

I make no guarantees for accuracy! But I will be citing my sources, so please do feel free to explore on your own or issue corrections.
